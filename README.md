# reactorfuse

Filesystem in userspace (FUSE) for Nim. This library uses asynchronous framework [reactor.nim](https://github.com/zielmicha/reactor.nim) for its IO.

## End note

Reading source code of [bazil fuse](https://github.com/bazil/fuse) and [this blog post](http://ptspts.blogspot.com/2009/11/fuse-protocol-tutorial-for-linux-26.html) helped me to understand kernel FUSE protocol.
